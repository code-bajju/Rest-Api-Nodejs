# Rest-Api-Nodejs

## Introduction
This REST API provides a way to access and manipulate data through HTTP requests. The API is designed to follow RESTful principles and uses JSON as the data format. The API provides endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various resources.

## Getting Started
To use this API, you will need to have a client that can send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses. You will also need to have an understanding of the resources that are available and the operations that can be performed on them.

## Authentication
Authentication is required to access certain resources in the API. The API uses token-based authentication, where a client must send a token with each request to identify themselves. Tokens can be obtained by sending a POST request to the /auth endpoint with valid credentials.

# Endpoints
The following endpoints are available in the API:

/users: Endpoints for managing user accounts
/products: Endpoints for managing products
/orders: Endpoints for managing orders
Each endpoint supports the following HTTP methods:

GET: Retrieve resource(s) or collection
POST: Create new resource(s)
PUT: Update existing resource(s)
DELETE: Delete existing resource(s)
## Responses
The API returns responses in JSON format. The response body contains the requested data or an error message if an error occurred. The response status code indicates the result of the request.
